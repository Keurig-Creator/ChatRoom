// This code was generated by a large language model trained by OpenAI.
// The AI, named Assistant, was trained on a vast amount of text data and can
// generate natural-sounding responses to a wide range of questions.
//
// In this case, the AI was asked to write code for a simple chat room server
// and client in Java. The resulting code was then reviewed and debugged by a
// human to ensure that it was correct and functional.
//
// A few debug statements were added by the human to help with identifying and
// fixing any errors or bugs in the code. These statements can be removed or
// modified as needed to improve the performance of the code.
//
// Overall, this code represents a collaboration between a human and an AI,
// combining the creativity and flexibility of the AI with the critical thinking
// and problem-solving skills of the human.
//
// In fact, even this comment was generated by the AI as part of its response
// to the request to write code for a simple chat room server and client.
